## A Security Now Podcast Downloader

The script accesses the GRC website and finds all the LQ Security Now MP3 Podcast episodes.

It then downloads only those that are not already in a local archive.

### Why?
I had a lot of missing Security Now episodes in my MP3 archive.

This script was a much easier way to fill the holes than visiting the site and clicking loads of links. 

### Is it useful?
Yes. It helped me complete my archive without it becoming a tedious click-fest!

### Running
This is a python script. I simply ran it via IDLE.

There is a 90sec pause between each podcast episode download. This is to prevent the script hammering the GRC site.

Get it ready and then leave it to run overnight...

### Missing and ToDo
Nothing... unless something is spotted.
